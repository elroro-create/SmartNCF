# SmartNCF
Smart Contracts for automatization of French Railway Services.

SNCF is one the most powerfull french compagny 'cause still the only Railway Compagny. SNCF is famous for regular delays and heavy aministrative documents.
The main goal of the project is to propose a smart automatic solution that could improve the consummer experience with SNCF. 

This project is one of my first about blockchain and smart contract developpement feel free to help me improve the code.

Step by step follow-up :

1/ Creating a constructor with all the users tickets
  Consumers are added with their First name, Last name, Ticket Reference and wallet address.
  
2/ Creating a constructor with alll the train
   Train are added with their departures, arrival station, we also put the potential delay time, the state (where 1 is arrival) AND an unique train reference code. By terms, sensors at all Station could certificate that train have arrived or not.
   
3/ Creating basic functions that allow administrators (sncf by terms) to get access to some basics data as where is which train etc.
